A large stone hearth dominates one side of the room, its crackling fire casting flickering shadows that dance along the wooden beams.\nBehind the counter stands Elara, the guild's innkeeper and owner, her silver hair catching the firelight like threads of moonlight. Her sharp green eyes seem to miss nothing, her presence calm yet commanding, as though the hall itself bends to her quiet authority.\nOpposite the fire, a job board leans slightly under the weight of countless pinned notices, their edges curled and inked words hinting at danger, rewards, or mystery. Nearby, the shopkeeper's stall is a burst of controlled chaos—shelves crowded with glimmering potions, polished weapons, and peculiar trinkets that beg for closer inspection.\nPerched on a counter, a sleek gray tabby cat surveys the scene through half-closed eyes, its contented purr blending seamlessly into the warmth of the hall. Here, decisions linger in every glance—whether to browse, rest, or step boldly into the unknown.\n\n",

He is hunched over in a small garden, carefully planting something in the rich, dark earth.

I'll go fetch the water.\"\n\n\"That's the spirit! Follow the path there, just past the barn.\n\nIt's a bit of a trek, but the well's deep and clear. Bring back a couple of buckets, and I'll have dinner ready by the time you get back.\n\nYou make your way to the well, the air growing quieter as you walk. After drawing two buckets of cool, clear water, you notice something half-buried in the underbrush. You kneel down and uncover an old, faded cloth pouch. Inside, you find a few small, smooth pebbles and a bit of worn string—nothing of real value, just odds and ends, as if someone had forgotten or discarded them.\n\nA sudden rustle from the trees catches your attention, and you quickly tuck the pouch into your bag, feeling an odd unease. You gather the buckets and head back toward the farmstead.\n\nYou return to the barn, water in hand, and the smell of stew wafts through the air. The farmer greets you with a nod, taking the buckets from you and leading you to the table.\n\n\"Right on time. Dinner's about ready, and you're welcome to stay the night. No need to keep traveling after dark.\"\n\nYou sit down to a simple meal of stew and bread, the warmth of the fire and the hearty food filling you with a sense of comfort.\n\n\"Not many folks come this way. It's quiet out here. Sometimes too quiet. But no need to worry about that. You've done me a good turn today, and I'm glad for the company.\"\n\nAfter the meal, the farmer leads you to a bedroll by the hearth. The fire crackles softly, and you feel the weight of the journey fall away as you settle in for the night.

The tension here stems from its proximity to the Wildkin Kingdom and lingering strife between humans and elves—struggles for land, power, and ancient knowledge. Many ancient relics lie buried beneath the earth, their presence a quiet reminder of the power and mystery of the old world.\n",
